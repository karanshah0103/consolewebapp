        Also known as a terminal or computer console, a console is a combination of a display monitor and an input device, typically a keyboard and/or mouse. It allows users to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. It is
        used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer. Chrome: To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows). As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage
        and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window. You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging
        as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console. Hope this Helps you when you are in problems! :^D
